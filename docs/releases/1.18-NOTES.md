## Release notes for kops 1.18 series

(The kops 1.18 release has not been released yet, this is a document to gather
the notes prior to the release).

# Breaking changes

* Please see the notes in the 1.15 release about the apiGroup changing from kops
  to kops.k8s.io

* Since 1.16, a controller is now used to apply labels to nodes.  If
  you are not using AWS, GCE or OpenStack your (non-master) nodes may
  not have labels applied correctly.

# Significant changes

# Required Actions

* If a custom Kops build was used on a cluster, a kops-controller Deployment may have been created that should get deleted.
  Run `kubectl -n kube-system delete deployment kops-controller` after upgrading to Kops 1.16.0-beta.1 or later.
